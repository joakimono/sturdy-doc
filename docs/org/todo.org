* [7/10] Setup of documentation

  - [X] define documentation targets (html, latex, man)
    With exhale only html is supported
  - [3/3] test doc2dash to export to docset target
    - [X] Add target that uses doc2dash
    - [X] It works, improve with [[https://kapeli.com/docsets#improveDocset]]
      But for some reason the icon.png is not extracted properly
    - [X] Compress docset and add xml template so that it can be served by a web service
  - [X] add pygments syntax highlighting
  - [X] add branding logo doxygen/rtd
  - [X] change color on top left
  - [X] use =exhale= to auto generate API doc, custom command
  - [X] add skeleton md/rst org-moded doc tree for non-API documentation
    - [[https://xtensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html][use this as inspiration]]
  - [6/7] add optional build step that compiles org files to rst/md
    - [X] ~emacs index.org --batch -l (load org and ox-rst) -f org-export-to-rst~
    - [X] make sure exported to an output directory and not in the source tree, but org files
    - [X] references relative to each other. Need to test this
    - [X] =broken-links= or =org-export-with-broken-links=
    - [X] [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22072773/batch-export-of-org-mode-files-from-the-command-line][useful?]]
    - [X] [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Include-Files.html][include files in org]]
    - [ ] See if you can fix some quirks on cross-referencing documents
  - [-] Plugins
    - [ ] =sphinx-versioning= to support multiple doc versions, upstream branches..
    - [X] =sphinx.ext.mathjax= example
    - [X] =recommonmark=, [[https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][this]] with example
    - [4/4] test plantuml in code (doxygen), org files and its export to sphinx/xml, =sphinxcontrib.plantuml=?
      - [X] Currently not supported in Breathe [[https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe/issues/435][see this issue]], found workaround with rst embedding
      - [X] =sphinxcontrib.plantuml= to support plantuml in rst?
      - [X] Export output from org-mode is possible
      - [X] Plantuml in markdown
  - [ ] Conditionally include stuff with directive =.. ifconfig::=, see [[https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/ifconfig.html][sphinx.ext.ifconfig]]
  - [X] Link between projects, use [[https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html][intersphinx]], see [[https://my-favorite-documentation-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_intersphinx.html#linking-to-other-sites-using-intersphinx][exhale intersphinx]]
