[7/10] Setup of documentation
-----------------------------

- ☑ define documentation targets (html, latex, man)
  With exhale only html is supported

- [3/3] test doc2dash to export to docset target

  - ☑ Add target that uses doc2dash

  - ☑ It works, improve with `https://kapeli.com/docsets#improveDocset <https://kapeli.com/docsets#improveDocset>`_
    But for some reason the icon.png is not extracted properly

  - ☑ Compress docset and add xml template so that it can be served by a web service

- ☑ add pygments syntax highlighting

- ☑ add branding logo doxygen/rtd

- ☑ change color on top left

- ☑ use ``exhale`` to auto generate API doc, custom command

- ☑ add skeleton md/rst org-moded doc tree for non-API documentation

  - `use this as inspiration <https://xtensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_

- [6/7] add optional build step that compiles org files to rst/md

  - ☑ ``emacs index.org --batch -l (load org and ox-rst) -f org-export-to-rst``

  - ☑ make sure exported to an output directory and not in the source tree, but org files

  - ☑ references relative to each other. Need to test this

  - ☑ ``broken-links`` or ``org-export-with-broken-links``

  - ☑ `useful? <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22072773/batch-export-of-org-mode-files-from-the-command-line>`_

  - ☑ `include files in org <https://orgmode.org/manual/Include-Files.html>`_

  - ☐ See if you can fix some quirks on cross-referencing documents

- ☒ Plugins

  - ☐ ``sphinx-versioning`` to support multiple doc versions, upstream branches..

  - ☑ ``sphinx.ext.mathjax`` example

  - ☑ ``recommonmark``, `this <https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ with example

  - [4/4] test plantuml in code (doxygen), org files and its export to sphinx/xml, ``sphinxcontrib.plantuml``?

    - ☑ Currently not supported in Breathe `see this issue <https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe/issues/435>`_, found workaround with rst embedding

    - ☑ ``sphinxcontrib.plantuml`` to support plantuml in rst?

    - ☑ Export output from org-mode is possible

    - ☑ Plantuml in markdown

- ☐ Conditionally include stuff with directive ``.. ifconfig::``, see `sphinx.ext.ifconfig <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/ifconfig.html>`_

- ☑ Link between projects, use `intersphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html>`_, see `exhale intersphinx <https://my-favorite-documentation-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_intersphinx.html#linking-to-other-sites-using-intersphinx>`_

.. todo::

    This needs to be done

- References

  - `doc2dash <https://gist.github.com/pbojinov/00a8159a83ac305af3c0>`_

  - `read the docs config <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring.html>`_

  - `org to restructuredtext <https://github.com/msnoigrs/ox-rst>`_

  .. conclusion:: Other doc test
      :name: ungiven2

      See how enumerable directives across docs work.
